The app was completely rebuilt!
Under the hood hides a new engine with even more power, which now also provides the current fuel prices and road-based collection dates for waste.
To make sure you don't forget to put the rubbish bin on the street, you can be reminded of the emptying the evening before with a push message.
Under the tab "Events" you can find events in Moers and the surrounding area and get more information about them.
SocialMedia contributions from the city of Moers are now displayed in the app as well.
The user interface has now become even faster and clearer and has been adapted to the new functions.
