DeckTransition is finally at 1.0! üéâ Here‚Äôs a summary of all the changes in this version

- Vastly improved performance
- Reorganized project structure
- Support for Carthage
- All ‚Äúmagic numbers‚Äù have been refactored out

One small change needs to be implemented in pre-1.0 projects to maintain compatibility with this version of DeckTransition. The entirety of the change consists of replacing the following line of code in your modal view controller‚Äôs `UIScrollViewDelegate` implementation

```swift
scrollView.transform = CGAffineTransform(translationX: 0, y: scrollView.contentOffset.y)
```

with the block that follows below:

```swift
scrollView.subviews.forEach {
    $0.transform = CGAffineTransform(translationX: 0, y: scrollView.contentOffset.y)
}
```

The implementation example in the ReadMe has been updated to reflect this.
