(*) With the \"Mörzz-Ticket\" introduced two years ago, € 15,-/€ 7,50 reduced in presale (€ 20,-/€ 10,- box-office), fans and friends of the festival gain access to a delicate selection of top-class events in clubs, churches, cafés and other facilities. Among them, the Solimare swimming centre should be highlighted, where underwater concerts take place at the ghostly hour (on Whit Monday at 7.30 p.m.) and where courageous visitors can enjoy special sound experiences (swimwear!). Those who relax on the swimming noodle get the sound from the depths and from above. The Mörzz ticket offers access to world-class concerts in special locations.";
